# Video Playback Speed Controller

This project expands on the idea of the ability to control the playback rate of a video. To accomplish this, a stylized sidebar next to the video is displayed at all times, allowing the user to finely control the pace at which the video plays for them. A textually-based indicator of the rate of speed is also displayed inside of the bar, providing more enhanced feedback and a better UX.
